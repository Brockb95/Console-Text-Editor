# Console-Text-Editor
A. Project Objectives

You have learned how to program in C and make a C project in Linux. In this project, you will
practice with your knowledge. You are expected to

a) Make a C project from scratch and develop a C program

b) Design and implement data structures and operations to process text

c) Learn to use the ncurses library and the standard IO library

d) Learn to manage a C project of multiple C files and libraries


USAGE:
The make command will compile and link all files into an executable "main". The new make file takes into account all new file names. To exit the program use ctrl+c. The window is using the cbreak() function so it recognizes ctrl+c as a close command.

DESIGN:
All text editing functions will be declared in one file named "edit.h" if you are adding a new function check to see if it is declared in "edit.h". If not declare it, and then implement it in "edit.c"
